Many people dismiss this as a common misconception. However, a new study conducted by Henry Li and Sara Yates, both Harvard professors, shows the opposite. "We were suprised by the results as well," Henry Li said when asked about the experiment.
   The procedure they followed included miniature cameras fitted inside of common name-brand gum. <img src = "https://www.stayathomemum.com.au/cache/555x700-0/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/feat-11.jpg" width = "50%"><br><span class = "caption">"Bugged Gum" used in the study</span><br><br>After fitting the cameras, the study continued for 10 years. Astonishingly, 93.2% of the 4,000 people participating in the study had the gum in their stomach for 7 or more years.
  Additionally, the scientists found that in 86% of these cases, not only the gum resin was retained, but the sugar and additives remained undissolved by the participants' stomach acid. The scientists remarked that they felt as though the field of gastrointerology could be entirely turned upside down by this study. Leading gastrointerologist Dr. Tom Harper commented, "We've never seen results of this magnitude before. I guess we've always just taken what we think we know about the digestive system for granted."</p>
